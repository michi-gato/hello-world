# hello-world
My first repository in GitHub

Hello GitHub world,

I see this is somewhat similar to Atlassian's JIRA. The gato named Michi will have half of her dinner in 22 minutes then the latter half right before I jump into bed.

Looking forward to injera and Ethiopian food for dinner tonight. 

Sincerely,
Sarah
